# Obsidian Agent

## Problem Statement

I use Obsidian as my primary second-brain for capturing everything interesting I read and for journaling. I wanted a tool to help me connect the dots between ideas using Obsidian links.

## Features

- Detailed Source Retrieval: Provides detailed sources for the chunks retrieved.

- Graph Utilization: Leverages Obsidian's links to improve the context of the retrieval.

- Intelligent Link Handling: Re-processes retrievals with link tags to combine responses effectively.

- Prompt: I optimized the prompt to focus on the connections, because I'm not necessarily looking to Q&A my notes, but to actually try to find common patterns and connections of the thoughts I have in the notes.
